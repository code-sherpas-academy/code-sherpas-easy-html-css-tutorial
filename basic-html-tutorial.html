        <h1>Basic HTML - Quick Reference</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>

        <h2>A few block-level elements:</h2>
        <p>"Block-level elements", also called "flow content" are always drawn in a new line.</p>

        <h3>Headings</h3>
        <p>Headings define outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

        <h3>Lists</h3>
            <p>This is how you make an <strong> unordered list</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add an <strong>&#60;ul&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;</strong> element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
                <li>Add each item in its own <strong>&#60;li&#62;&#60;/li&#62;</strong> element</li>
                <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This is how an <strong> ordered list </strong> looks like</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Notice the new <strong>&#60;ol&#62;&#60;/ol&#62;</strong> element wrapping everything</li>
                <li>But,the list item elements are the same</li>
                <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
                <li>You should be noticing things is the precise order because this is an ordered list</li>
            </ol>
        
        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>"Inline elements" are also called "phrasing content". Inline elements can affect sections of text anywhere within a line</p>

        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase. Use <strong> &#60;em&#62;&#60;/em&#62;</strong> tag for italic.</p>
        <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase. Use <strong>&#60;strong&#62;</strong> tag.</p>
        <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em>. Combine &#60;strong&#62; and &#60;em&#62; tags.</p>

        <h4>Structure vs Presentation</h4>
        <p>You might be wondering why we're using the terms "emphasis" and "strong" instead of 
            "italic" and "bold". That brings us to an important distinction between HTML and CSS. HTML markup should
            provide <em>semantic</em> information about your content - not <em>presentational</em> information. In other words,
            HTML shoud define the structure of your document, leaving its appearance to CSS.
        </p>
        <p>The pseudo-obsolete &#60;b&#62; and &#60;i&#62; elements are classic examples of this. They used to stand for "bold"
            and "italic", respectively, but HTML5 attempted to create a clear separation between a document's structure and its presentation.
            Thus &#60;i&#62; was replaced with &#60;em&#62;, since emphasized text can be displayes in all sorts of ways aside from being italicized.
            Same for &#60;b&#62; and &#60;strong&#62;.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks to CSS we can alter the browser's default rendering of the &#60;strong&#62; and &#60;em&#62; elements. This furthers the point
            that we shouldn't call it out as italized or bold text in the HTML, that's something for CSS to decide.
        </p>

        <h2>Empty HTML elements</h2>
        <p>Some HTML elements can be "empty" or "self-closing". <strong>Line breaks</strong> and <strong>horizontal rules</strong> are the most common
             empty elements you'll find.</p>
        
        <h3>Line breaks</h3>

        <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
        <p>Regards,
            The Authors
        </p>

        <p>The new line after regards is transformed into a space instead of displaying as a line break</p>

        <p>To tell the browser that we want a hard line break, we need to use an explicit &#60;br&#62; element, like this:</p>

        <p>Regards, <strong>&#60;br/&#62;</strong><br/>
        The Authors</p>

        <h3>Horizontal rules</h3>

        <p> The <strong>&#60;hr/&#62;</strong> element is a "horizontal rule,
            which represents a thematic break. The transition from on scene of a story into the next or between
            the end of a letter and a postcript are good examples of when a horizontal rule may be appropriate. 
        </p>
        <p>Like <strong>&#60;br/&#62;, &#60;hr/&#62;</strong> should carry meaning
            --don't use it when you just want to display a line for the sake of aesthetics. For that, you'll
            want to use the CSS "border" property.
        </p>

        <p>Another way to think about the &#60;hr/&#62; element is that it carries <em>less</em> signifiance
            than the separation created by a new heading element, but <em>more</em>
            signifiance than a new paragraph.
            <br/>
            For instance:</p>

        The authors</p>

        <strong>&#60;hr/&#62;</strong> <hr/>

        <p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS soon.</p>

            <li>Web pages are made of HTML elements.</li>
            <li>Each element adds a different meaning to the text it contains.</li>
            <li>Elements can be nested inside of each other.</li>
